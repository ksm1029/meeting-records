### Attending

- Karl Miller, President
- Davis Moore, Vice President,
- Anthony Clark, Quartermaster,
- Bryan Robbins, Discord Administrator,
- Kaitlin McManus, Secretary

### Resolved

- (5-0)  Karl shall contact Professor Shallow and propose the web app as follows:

> A technical news aggregator site geared towards programming and software development. The first MVP phase will be based on the Reddit API. It will identify top posts in dozens or more programming related subreddits which exceed the typical average for a top post and present the underlying articles to website visitors in a feed. Later iterations will have users/logins, comments, and scraping of other sources. The project will be monetized with Google Adwords ASAP to provide additional funding for the club.

- (5-0) Approved Meet and Greet date and location setting, subject to review 

> A Meet and Greet will be held on 7/24/2021 at NOON. We will meet at Brady Sullivan Plaza on Elm Street then head to Boards and Brews. This time may be subject to change depending on feedback before the next meeting on 7/17.

### Discussions
