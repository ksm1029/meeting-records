### Other Discussions 

- Discussed remaining officer roles, and elected Anthony Clark to serve as Quartermaster. Still need a Treasurer, however.
- Discussed internships and career prospects.
- Discussed a proposition for a faculty led project over the summer. It will be a web application and involve technologies such as Docker and Jira. The actual purpose of the app is yet to be decided. Will meet with Professor Shallow, the project's proposer, in early May, to hear more details.
- Discussed the 'seed of a project idea' mentioned by Vice President Davis Moore - something using the Canvas API to, for example, tell students the next 3 assignments are due or provide different grade estimates.
