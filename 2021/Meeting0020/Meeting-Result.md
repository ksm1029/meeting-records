- Bryan Robbins, Discord Administrator

### Resolved

- No resolutions

### Discussions 

- Met on campus in 1st floor Zoom room for in-person meeting. Campus is probably not the best place to hold meetings. Wildcat Passes will be required in the future which means regular testing and such, and will exclude members who don't attend in-person. It also closes at 4:00 pm on Saturdays. I suggest that we do Boards & Brews again in the future for meet and greets but continue doing meetings via Discord. For one, there is zero commute time. For another, every member has access to all their technology, including Desktop computers, so we can jump right into coding and such after meetings. It is nice to see people in person, however, so doing regular Boards and Brews meet + greet I believe would be nice. 
- I am going to be moving to Southwest Pennslyvania and transferring to California University of Pennsylvania. As such, someone else will have to take on the responsibility of being president. I am willing to stay on until we find someone willing to take over. After resigning, I am willing to stay on in an advisor / adjunct member role per our constitution and assist in any way I can. 
- Engagement could be improved by putting our name in The Flush.
