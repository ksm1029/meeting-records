Hello everyone! Thank you for your interest in the UNHM Programming club.

Right now, we are an unofficial organization. The first meeting is so we can define our purpose and find who is interested in taking on a role in this project. I have only reached out to a few people from my classes so far. After this meeting, I intend to reach out to faculty contacts and cast a wider net. If you know someone who would be interested, however, feel free to invite them.

Everyone attending the first meeting will be treated as an interim officer of the club, with the power to vote on all resolutions. This is discussed in more detail under the “Meeting Structure” heading of this email.

## Intro / The Pitch

Most schools have a Computer Science or related club. UNHM does not. This needs to change. 

Our degree is worth what we put into it, what we choose to learn, what connections we strive to make. We can learn a lot in our classes and from our professors, but there are some important things that are missed. For one, in class, most programming is done solo. But in a professional setting, we will always be working in a group.

It is to your advantage to build skills that will help you to land a great job and thrive in the professional world. Foremost among those skills are teamwork, organization, and peer programming. Our degree curriculums are limited in how much time they devote to these important areas. This club will fill those gaps and level up those skills as we collaborate on cool projects. It will help us connect with each other and others in the field. It will expose us to new strategies for approaching software development. It will inform us about events, like hackathons, where we can network with professionals in the field. It will expose us to resources and technologies we can add to our arsenal, and provide us experience in the actual languages and libraries employers are looking for their candidates to be proficient in.

It will provide the opportunity to learn invaluable, employment-ready skills not easily acquired by simply attending classes.

If you are willing to invest your energy in this project with me, you will be able to add “Founding Member of the UNHM Programming Club” to your resume, and that’s sure to catch an employer’s eye. You can help create something excellent that will serve you and your peers well. Plus, if you enjoy programming like I do, this club will be a lot of fun. 

## Programming Club vs. Computer Science Club

The working name of this project is the “Programming Club” because the “Computer Science Club” sounds like a club where you debate the algorithmic merits of quicksort. We can learn that in Data Structures class. I see the purpose of this club as filling the gaps that our degree program does not handle, the co-curricular side of our education.

Additionally, not everyone who programs is a Computer Science major. I want this club to appeal to CIT and Data Science majors as well – to everyone pursuing UNHM’s “computing technologies” degrees, and, in fact, to everyone at our school interested in programming.

But the name of this club is on the first meeting agenda for voting if you disagree with it.

## Meeting Structure

While I’ve never founded a student organization, I’ve sat on the board of directors at a VFW post for many years. There is a way to conduct things in an orderly manner without being overly formal so as to actually get stuff done. So, I intend to run this first meeting like we run board of directors meetings every month. Some of you may have participated in that sort of organization before, but I want to explain what that process looks like in case you haven't.

We will have an agenda for the meeting, which you can find under the **Agenda** section of this email. During the meeting, we will run through the agenda items one by one. Save your input on a given item until we get to that item.

We will vote on each agenda item that calls for it. Everyone at the initial meeting here will be treated as if they’re an officer of the club. You get 1 vote on each item – Yay, Nay, or Abstain.

Down the line, we will have an elected slate of officers who will vote on club resolutions. For this initial, pre-Constitution club, everyone at the first meeting will be an acting officer and get maximum voting priviledges. 

If you want to propose a resolution, just say “I want to propose that we resolve to….”

Someone else has to “second” your resolution by saying “seconded”.

The President will say “A resolution to…. Is up for vote”.

Everyone votes “Aye, Nay, or Abstain”. Since we are going to be remote, it’s best if you type your vote into the chat as well as saying it.

The President will tally the votes and declare whether the resolution passed or not.

If the vote passes, it will be added to the list of resolutions and we will implement it.

At the next meeting, the agenda will include a list of what resolutions passed at the previous meeting
If you have any agenda items you’d like to add to this meeting, you can email me or bring them up at the end of the meeting, after the other agenda items are dealt with.

For the first meeting, I’ll assume the role of “Interim President” because someone has to direct things. Among the first agenda items is going to be a resolution as to whether you want to elect me as interim President. By the time we go official, we will elect officers. If anyone wants to assume the role of Interim Vice President, (or if you think you’d like to tackle the job of being Interim President) you are welcome to say so and we can put that up to a vote too.

## Agenda

The agenda, proposed Interim Constitution and proposed Club Accounts Procedure are viewable at:

All meeting agendas will be posted to that github repo.

## When/Where

I have scheduled the first meeting with Zoom, since it is a technology we are all familiar with from our UNHM classes. I don't love Zoom and am open to trying different technologies.

I’m setting the date for next Saturday, 3/13, at 12:00 PM. I figured that this date and time is likely to work for most, since there will not be conflicts with UNHM classes. However, some of you may have jobs or other obligations. If this date and time does not work for you, please email me back with your availability and I will look to find another time that works best for everyone.

Down the line, it would be nice if we could meet occasionally in person, at a coffee shop or on campus, once circumstances and school rules allow.

I also think creating a Discord channel would be a good way for us to communicate asynchronously. 

## Conclusion

Thanks for taking an interest in this club. I’m excited to have the opportunity to be part of this. I hope you see the great value in what we can do here. I know we have some great minds among us and I look forward to seeing what we build together.

Please let me know via email whether you can make the initial meeting.

I look forward to seeing you next Saturday! (unless we have to reschedule)



Sincerely,

Karl Miller
