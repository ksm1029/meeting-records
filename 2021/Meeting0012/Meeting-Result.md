### Resolved

- (7-0) Amended the Constitution of the Programming Club to allow for asynchronous voting:
> Constitutional Amendment: Article V section 1: Meeting attendees may elect to put an important matter to an asynchronous vote of the club or board on the Discord, if quorum cannot be met or if it is felt that said matter should be put to asynchronous vote. Before the next scheduled meeting, members may vote, and if the total number of members exceed quorum and the measure passes, it will be considered passed as though those members attended the meeting.‚Äù

- (7-0) Approved Professor Shallow faculty-led project - web app
- (7-0) Voted that the club will not inquire into members vaccination status for the meet-and-greet or other purposes. When we are inviting members to said meet-and-greet, we will let them know to assume some members are and some members are not vaccinated. 

### Discussions 

- Discussed Prof. Shallows web app idea. We are leaning towards creating a place for users to swap computing resources, information, technical help. Something that looks like a cross between reddit and stack overflow, incorperating upvotes and downvotes and keyword searches. Also were considering inspiration from the recently-closed Yahoo Answers.

- Discussed Meet and Greet for July/August. Some members may be a little further away but would likely be willing to travel for it. Discussed whether the club should involve itself in asking about people's vaccine status before voting that it should not.
