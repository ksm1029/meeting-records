### Article IV - Elections

_proposed / draft_

The club will hold a general election for all officers at the beginning of the semester. All members meeting the membership requirements will be entitled to one vote for each officer. Individuals with the majority of votes will be appointed to that officer role.

Changes to the Constitution will be proposed and approved by officers. If approved, they will be presented to the entire club for a general vote. If 2/3rds of the club membership agrees to the change, the Constitution will be updated by the Secretary or Club President to reflect that.

Changes to the club account procedures will be conducted by a meeting of the officers.

Discord rules and organization will be unilaterally decided by the Discord Admins. If there is a conflict between discord administrators and/or club membership, club officers may vote by majority to change discord rules, and Discord Administrators will not override this.

### Article V - Meetings

_proposed / draft_

Club discussion will be available asynchronously on Discord to members at any time.

Member-wide club meetings will only need to occur at specific times, such as when preparing for a school event. In these circumstances, club officers will vote by majority to hold a club-wide meeting where attendance by all members will be expected.

_to-do_: In conjuction with membership requirement of presenting code, how should we handle meetings where that can happen? Once every two weeks? On Discord? Requirement to attend 1 or 2 of these meetings and give other members feedback on their code? 

Special meetings for presentation by alumni 

Club officers will meet once per week, at Saturday at Noon, unless they choose another time, which need only be ratified by simple majority of officers.

Members working on team projects will communicate with their team in the manner set forth by the team leader.
