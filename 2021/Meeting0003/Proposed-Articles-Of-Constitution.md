### Article VII - Conduct

_to be proposed at meeting 3_

Any conversations on the club discord or in club meetings that violate UNHM's academic honestly policy are disallowed. If a member wants help with their homework, helping members should ask them socratic questions or point them to useful resources, but shall not complete their homework for them or hand them the answers.

This club will be apolitical. It will never make any official statements about topical political issues. The club is about programming only, not about politics. Politics also have no place on the Discord server, which shall be about Programming and UNH.

In accordance with the University of New Hampshire non-discrimination statement, this club will not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity expression, disability, veteran status, marital status, genetic information, pregnancy, or political orientation. These facets of an individual will not be considered when voting or appointing them to an officer role, as a member of a committee, as a group project leader, or any other position. Discussions about these things also generally do not belong on the discord or in meetings, as they do not relate to programming. 

Sexual harrassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Any member who sexually harasses any individual on a club communication platform will be expelled from the club and be reported to the university or the authorities. This club will be a place where all sexes can be comfortable and be treated equally, without having to worry about harassment. This means there is to be no discussion of sex in the discord or in meetings.

Vulgar language is not permitted in the Discord or in meetings. While sometimes individuals accidentally swear, consistant violators may face censure, muting, or, in egregious cases, explusion.

Members will treat each other with respect and kindness. Members will show patience with members who do not have as much programming experience as they do. Members will not mock or bully other members.

### Article VIII - Ratification

This constitution shall be approved by a 2/3rds vote of all members.
