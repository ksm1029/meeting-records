All are welcome to attend the next meeting, on Saturday, 3/20/21, at 12:00 noon, on Zoom. This is your chance to get in on the ground floor and make an imprint on this organization. 

Some things you might do in the Programming Club:

 - Contribute in small or large part to a video game semester project.
 - Examine and ask questions about another member's code they present.
 - Explain/Present how your code works.
 - Hear an alumnus discuss their experience working in tech and have the opportunity to ask them questions.

This club can benefit programmers of _all_ skill levels. If you have a desire to learn about computer languages, software development, and teamwork, this is your opportunity.
