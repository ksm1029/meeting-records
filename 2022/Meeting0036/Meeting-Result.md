### 1/7/2022

### Attending

- Karl Miller, President
- Davis Moore, Vice President


### Resolved

_No resolutions_

### Discussions 

- Davis found a polaroid camera he's been restoring.

- Discussed ideas for increasing meeting attendees:
	- Is attendance low because we spend too much time on administrative voting type stuff?
	- Is attendance low simply cause of the school demographic and cause of not getting a ton of exposure?
	- Could we do more actual programming in meetings?
	- Could we have more specific agendas and goals?

- We should try doing some actual programming in meetings and devote some time to that.

- We may need a re-vote on meeting times at some point and should include that on next weeks agenda.

### Agenda next meeting 

- How are meeting times working?
- Status of IT
- Club Crawler programming
